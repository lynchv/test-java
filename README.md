Things to potentially add:
- Use a DB to store the flights information
- Unit tests
- User input validation
- Allow user to enter path to JSON order file
- Print order list sorted for the order number
- Automatically schedule orders on start up and when adding new flight
- Add reason for order "not scheduled" ex: No flights with destination; No more space
